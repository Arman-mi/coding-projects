Gitlet used to be one of the projects for my school but my school stopped support for it some years ago. I was interensred in how it is implemented so I gave it a shot myself. 
at the moment Git restore has a small bug and I have not implemented merge yet. I am very busy with school right now so I don't have a lot of free time on my hands but 
fixing this is one of my priorities during the break. for now enjoy this version of it :).
