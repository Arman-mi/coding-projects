The Medical AI was one of my own personal projects. the inspiration behind it was my roommate which has recently become an EMT. 
basically the project tries to simualte a real life EMT response call and grades you based on your performance.
I trained the model using a data set I created myself but the dataset I created requires more data entries for the model to give more accurate responses.
accoridng to my testing using a pretrained model works a lot better but I included my own version of the model since getting a BERT generalized model isnt a complex task :)
