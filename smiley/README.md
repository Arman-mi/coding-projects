Smiley is an arcade 2D style video game. it was a project for school. the version the school asked for was very basic, after turning it in I added additional features to make the game more engaging.
When loading into the game press N to start a new game. afterwards type any random numbers to generate your world and after that press S to launch the game. 
the game is a survival based game. every round a new entity spawns(enemy types) to hunt you! you can press the spacebar to defend yourself from the enemies and attack them. there are potions in the world
that restore health. see how high of a round you can achieve. in order to not lose your progress a save game method has been implemented. in order to quit the game just press Q and the game automatically saves 
your progress so the next time you boot up the game press L to load your game and then continue where you left off.
the school provided us with a render class and a tile class for us to generate our worlds. everyhting else is my own work. Enjoy :)
