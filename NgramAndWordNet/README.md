This project was a project for school, the front end in which how the NGram is launched displayed is not my work but everything else on the backend side is all mine :).
please download the dataset at the following link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/155ZwViR90eoIpa1Si7dUAk7o0R04SEPG/view?usp=sharing
after that make sure the data directory is at the same level at which the src directory is
in order to view the final product of this project (after downloading the data) please run main, after running main your server is now launched.
now go to the static directory, and open the ngordnet.html file in a browser of your choice. now enjoy my implementation of the NGram and the Wordent :).
