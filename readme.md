hello and welcome to my repository
for the projects that are written in java please import the provided Javalibrary directory for your project structure
each project has an imbeded design doc going through how the project was designed and developed
each project has a README file that explains a little about the project and how to use the code
in order to fully understand how the projects work I recommend reading the Design Doc and the README files in each directory
if there are any questions regarding the code or the projects feel free to email me at arman_meysami@berkeley.edu 
I would be happy to help clear things up or answer your question
